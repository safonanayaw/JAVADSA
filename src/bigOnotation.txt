Big O Notation
"How code slows es data grows"
1.Describes the perfomance of algorithm as the amount of data increase.
2.Machine independent (# of steps to completion)
3. Ignore smaller operations O(n + 1) -> O(n)
Example
O(1): Constant Time
    1.Random access of an element in an array
    2.Insertion at the beginning of linkedList

O(log n): Logarithmic Time
    1. Binary Search

 0(n): Linear Time
    1.Looping through an array
    2.Searching through a linked List

O(n log n): Quasiliear Time
    1.Quick sort
    2.Merge Sort
    3.Heap Sort

, O(n^2): Quadratic Time
    1.Insertion Sort
    2.Selection Sort
    3.Bubble Sort

O(n!): Factorial Time
    1. Traveling salesman problem
